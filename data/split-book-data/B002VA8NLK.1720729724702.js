window.bookSummaryJSON = "Cormac McCarthy, best-selling author of National Book Award winner <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>, delivers his first new novel in seven years. Written in muscular prose, <i>No Country for Old Men</i> is a powerful tale of the West that moves at a blistering pace. <p>Llewelyn Moss is hunting antelope near the Texas-Mexico border when he stumbles upon several dead men, a big stash of heroin, and more than two million dollars in cash. He takes off with the money, and the hunter becomes the haunted. A drug cartel hires a former Special Forces agent to track down the loot, and a ruthless killer joins the chase as well. Also looking for Moss is the aging Sheriff Bell, a World War II veteran who may be Moss' only hope for survival.</p> <p>Raw and lean, <i>No Country for Old Men</i> is another masterpiece from one of America's acclaimed novelists.</p>";
