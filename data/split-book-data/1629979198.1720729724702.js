window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It would be difficult to overstate the influence of <i>The Federalist Papers</i>. Despite their lack of official or legal status, these 85 brilliant essays have served as the single most important guide to the interpretation and application of the US Constitution for more than 230 years. Authored by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, <i>The Federalist Papers</i> offer a detailed blueprint for building a successful democratic republic. </p> <p><i>Books That Matter: The Federalist Papers</i> gives you the chance to delve into this magisterial blueprint for yourself. Taught by acclaimed professor and legal scholar Joseph L. Hoffmann of the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, these 12 thought-provoking lectures take you back to the hot summer weather of Philadelphia in 1787, when the delegates from the several states gathered to revise the Articles of Confederation. </p> <p>As you will learn, the Framers were rightly concerned about whether the 13 largely autonomous states would accept a strong centralized federal government and whether such a system could include safeguards to protect against the tyranny they’d just fought a war to overcome. To answer these concerns, the authors laid out a bold vision for the new nation, drafting what became essentially the Bible of American government - perhaps America’s most significant contribution to the way that human beings choose to organize their lives, and their societies, in order to fulfill their hopes and pursue their dreams together.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
