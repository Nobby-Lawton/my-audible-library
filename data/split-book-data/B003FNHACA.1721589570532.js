window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Robert Jackson Bennett makes a stunning debut with this deliciously dark tale sure to hold readers in its menacing thrall. The grinding poverty brought on by the Great Depression is nowhere more apparent than in the untold thousands looking for work along America’s railroad system. But one man haunting the rail camps has been moved by an entirely different brand of desperation: revenge. And Marcus Connelly won’t stop until hee avenges his daughter’s brutal murder at the hands of a monster known as <i>Mr. Shivers</i>.</p>";
