window.bookSummaryJSON = "Hidden within the rituals of the creation of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> is a fascinating mystery. Professor James Murray was the distinguished editor of the OED project. Dr. William Chester Minor, an American surgeon who had served in the Civil War, was one of the most prolific contributors to the dictionary, sending thousands of neat, hand-written quotations from his home. After numerous refusals from Minor to visit his home in Oxford, Murray set out to find him. It was then that Murray would finally learn the truth about Minor - that, in addition to being a masterly wordsmith, he was also an insane murderer locked up in Broadmoor, England's harshest asylum for criminal lunatics. <i>The Professor and the Madman</i> is the unforgettable story of the madness and genius that contributed to one of the greatest literary achievements in the history of English letters.";
