window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The official nonfiction companion to the History Channel dramatic series <i>Texas Rising</i> (produced by the same team that made the record-breaking <i>Hatfields and McCoys</i>): a thrilling new narrative history of the Texas Revolution and the rise of the legendary Texas Rangers who patrolled the violent Western frontier. </p> <p>In 1836, if west of the Mississippi was considered the Wild West, then Texas was hell on earth - a hot bed of conflict. Who would win the war over Texas? Crushed from the outside by Mexican armadas and attacked from within by ferocious Comanche tribes, no one was safe. But this was a time of bravery, a time to die for what you believed in and a time to stand tall against the cruel rule of the Mexican General Santa Anna and his forces. The Texas Rangers, a ragtag crew of men fighting on horseback, were often outnumbered by as many as 50 to one. Yet under renowned General Sam Houston, they achieved victory against nearly impossible odds, earning a legendary place in American history. </p> <p>Acclaimed Texas historian Stephen L. Moore's <i>Texas Rising</i>, the official companion to the epic History series of the same name, brings to life the violent Texas frontier and the Rangers' heroic deeds during the Texas Revolution. Published with the full support and backing of history, <i>Texas Rising</i> is an unforgettable history of this iconic band of fighters. </p>";
