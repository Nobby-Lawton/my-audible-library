window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In Queen's Bench Courtroom Number Seven, famous author Abraham Cady stands trial. In his book <i>The Holocaust</i> - born of the terrible revelation that the Jadwiga Concentration camp was the site of his family's extermination - Cady shook the consciousness of the human race. He also named eminent surgeon Sir Adam Kelno as one of Jadwiga's most sadistic inmate/doctors. Kelno has denied this and brought furious charges. Now unfolds Leon Uris' riveting courtroom drama - one of the great fictional trials of the century.</p>";
