window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller</b></p> <p><b>The heart-wrenching, uplifting tale about a woman named Cupcake</b></p> <p><b>“[Cupcake] Brown’s confessional...memoir is one you can’t easily put down. Her life is nothing short of a miracle.” (</b><b><i>Chicago Sun-Times</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p>There are shelves of memoirs about overcoming the death of a parent, childhood abuse, rape, drug addiction, miscarriage, alcoholism, hustling, gangbanging, near-death injuries, drug dealing, prostitution, and homelessness. </p> <p>Cupcake Brown survived all these things before she’d even turned 20. And that’s when things got interesting....Orphaned by the death of her mother and left in the hands of a sadistic foster parent, young Cupcake Brown learned to survive by turning tricks, downing hard liquor, and ingesting every drug she could find while hitchhiking up and down the California coast. She stumbled into gangbanging, drug dealing, hustling, prostitution, theft, and, eventually, the best scam of all: a series of 9-to-5 jobs. </p> <p><i>A Piece of Cake</i> is unlike any memoir you’ll ever read. Moving in its frankness, this is the most satisfying, startlingly funny, and genuinely affecting tour through hell you’ll ever take. </p> <p>Praise for <i>A Piece of Cake</i></p> <p>“[Brown] reflects now with insight and honesty on her experiences....An engaging account...of a remarkable life filled with pain and wisdom, hope and redemption.” (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>) </p> <p>“Dazzles you with the amazing change that is possible in one lifetime.” (<i>Washington Post</i>)</p>";
