window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imagine living with a fear so visceral each day that simply walking down the street draws terror to one’s core. That’s the best case scenario for a woman on the streets of Juárez, Mexico. Kate del Castillo (<i>La Reina del Sur</i>) delivers a stunning one-woman performance that transports listeners from a New York stage to the treacherous streets of Juárez, Mexico, where thousands of women have been murdered in an ongoing epidemic of violence. Written by Isaac Gomez (Steppenwolf’s <i>La Ruta</i>) and based on his intimate interviews, <i>the way she spoke</i> is a raw and riveting exploration of responsibility and follows one playwright's journey to give voice to a city of women silenced by violence, fear, and a world that has turned a deaf ear to their stories. This poignant and unforgettable play is directed by Obie and Lucille Lortel–winner Jo Bonney.</p> <p>Written by Isaac Gomez <br> Performed by Kate del Castillo <br> Directed by Jo Bonney <br> Original Theatrical Sound Design by Elisheba Ittoop</p> <p><b>Note: the way she spoke contains mature language and themes, and graphic description of violence against women.
