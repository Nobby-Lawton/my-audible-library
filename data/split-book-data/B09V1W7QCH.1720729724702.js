Although Sofie and Jürgen do not share the social views growing popular in Hitler’s Germany, Jürgen’s position with its burgeoning rocket program changes their diminishing fortunes for the better. But as Sofie watches helplessly, her beloved Berlin begins to transform, forcing her to consider what they must sacrifice morally for their young family’s security, and what the price for their neutrality will be.<br> <br> Twenty years later, Jürgen is one of the many German scientists offered pardons for their part in the war, and taken to America to work for its fledgling space program. For Sofie, this is the chance to exorcise the ghosts that have followed her across the ocean, and make a fresh start in her adopted country. But her neighbors aren’t as welcoming or as understanding as she had hoped. When scandalous rumors about the Rhodes family’s affiliation with Hitler’s regime spreads, idle gossip turns to bitter rage, and the act of violence that results will tear apart Sofie’s community and her family before the truth is finally revealed.<br> <br> <b>“An unforgettable novel that explores important questions highly relevant to the world today.” —Christine Wells, author of </b><b><i>Sisters of the Resistance</i></b><br> <br> <b>Don’t miss Kelly Rimmer’s newest novel, </b><b><i>The Paris Agent</i></b><b>, where a family’s innocent search for answers brings a long-forgotten, twenty-five-year-old mystery featuring two female SOE operatives comes to light!</b><br> <br> For more by Kelly Rimmer, look for:</p> <ul> <li><i>Before I Let You Go</i></li> <li><i>The Things We Cannot Say</i></li> <li><i>Truths I Never Told You</i></li> <li><i>The Warsaw Orphan</i></li> </ul>";
