window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Graham Norton, the BAFTA-award-winning Irish television host and author of the \"sparkling and impish\" (<i>Daily Mail</i>) memoirs <i>The Life and Loves of a He Devil</i> and <i>So Me</i>, comes a charming debut novel set in an idyllic Irish village where a bumbling investigator has to sort through decades of gossip and secrets to solve a mysterious crime. </p> <p>The remote Irish village of Duneen has known little drama, but when human remains are discovered on an old farm, suspected to be those of Tommy Burke - a former lover of two different inhabitants - the village's dark past begins to unravel. As the frustrated sergeant PJ Collins struggles to solve a genuine case for the first time in his life, he unearths a community's worth of anger and resentments, secrets and regret. </p> <p>In this darkly comic, touching and, at times, heartbreaking novel, perfect for fans of J.K. Rowling's <i>The Casual Vacancy</i>, Graham Norton employs his acerbic wit to breathe life into a host of loveable characters and explore - with searing honesty - the complexities and contradictions that make us human. </p>";
