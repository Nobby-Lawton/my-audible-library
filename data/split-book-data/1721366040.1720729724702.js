window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning author of </b><b><i>We, the Drowned</i></b><b> comes a brutal, unflinching, and bestselling epic novel of a platoon of soldiers descending into the insanity of the war in Afghanistan.</b></p> <p>Dispatched to fight the Taliban as part of the NATO forces, the soldiers of the Third Platoon arrive in a desert hell intent on testing their courage and endurance.</p> <p>Among them are the charismatic platoon leader Schrøder, a former games designer fascinated by the imaginative potential of war; Colonel Steffensen, whose negotiating tactics will have deadly consequences; Sidekick, the LifeLogger whose online “war memorial” will blur into horror; and the hardened but vulnerable Hannah, who must bury her womanhood - or sacrifice her soul.</p> <p>Confronted by a betrayal that no military training could prepare them for, the soldiers must embark on a desperate mission to track down an enemy whose methods are as murderous as they are unfathomable.</p> <p>As the hunters become the hunted, the mission turns into a depraved, hallucinatory voyage into an Afghanistan they never knew existed. With the Third Platoon’s most fundamental notions of good and evil called into question, survival becomes their only mission.</p> <p>An explicitly brutal portrait of battle told with the propulsion of a harrowing psychological thriller, <i>The First Stone</i> is a stunning and epic depiction of comradeship, humanity, and the bestial realities of a conflict without end.</p>";
