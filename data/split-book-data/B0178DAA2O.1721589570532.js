window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Something wants in. To your head. Through this book. </p> <p>Ethan, a digital sound engineer in Los Angeles, becomes aware that his life is unraveling when an audiobook reveals his deepest, darkest secrets, escalating until the narrator addresses him directly, threatening to destroy him from within. Vivian, a single mother running an antique store in San Francisco, listens to her audiobook to distract herself from missing her young daughter but is shaken when the narrative is interrupted by her daughter's voice, faintly calling for help. </p> <p>Ethan and Vivian are drawn together as they fight to solve a generation-spanning conspiracy that begins with a boy listening to the Orson Welles broadcast of <i>War of the Worlds</i> in 1938 and evolves through the latest innovations in digital technology, unearthing the mind-bending concept of a possibility parasite bent on unleashing an explosion of apocalyptic meta horror. </p> <p>Conceptually striking and intimately disturbing, <i>Interference</i> is a cutting-edge science fiction/horror thriller that will resonate with an audience acquainted with the paranoia inherent in the latest technology that pervades our lives. </p>";
