window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hailed by Salman Rushdie as a “brilliantly innovative thriller-writer,” Philip Kerr is the creator of taut, gripping, noir-tinged mysteries set in Nazi-era Berlin that are nothing short of spellbinding. The first book of the Berlin Noir trilogy, <i>March Violets</i> introduces listeners to Bernie Gunther, an ex-policeman who thought he’d seen everything on the streets of 1930s Berlin - until he turned freelance and each case he tackled sucked him further into the grisly excesses of Nazi subculture. Hard-hitting, fast-paced, and richly detailed, <i>March Violets</i> is noir listening at its best and blackest. </p> <p>“Echoes of Raymond Chandler but better on his vivid and well-researched detail than the master” (<i>Evening Standard</i>)</p>";
