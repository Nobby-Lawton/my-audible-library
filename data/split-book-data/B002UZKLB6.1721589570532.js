window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time</p> <p>From the Modern Library’s new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner—also available are <i>Snopes, The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, Absalom, Absalom!</i>, and <i>Selected Short Stories</i></p> <p>One of William Faulkner’s finest novels, <i>As I Lay Dying</i>, originally published in 1930, remains a captivating and stylistically innovative work. The story revolves around a grim yet darkly humorous pilgrimage, as Addie Bundren’s family sets out to fulfill her last wish: to be buried in her native Jefferson, Mississippi, far from the miserable backwater surroundings of her married life. Told through multiple voices, <i>As I Lay Dying</i> vividly brings to life Faulkner’s imaginary South, one of literature’s great invented landscapes, and is replete with the poignant, impoverished, violent, and hypnotically fascinating characters that were his trademark. </p> <p>Along with a new Foreword by E. L. Doctorow, this edition reproduces the corrected text of <i>As I Lay Dying</i> as established in 1985 by Faulkner expert Noel Polk.</p>";
