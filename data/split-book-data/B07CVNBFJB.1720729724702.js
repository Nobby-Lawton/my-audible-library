window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This audiobook is the classic one-volume history of the American Civil War by Pulitzer Prize winner Bruce Catton. Covering events from the prelude of the conflict to the death of Lincoln, Catton blends a gripping narrative with deep, yet unassuming, scholarship to bring the war alive in an almost novelistic way. It is this gift for narrative that led contemporary critics to compare this book to <i>War and Peace</i>, and call it a \"modern <i>Iliad</i>.\" Now over 50 years old, <i>This Hallowed Ground</i> remains one of the best-loved and admired general Civil War books: a perfect introduction to listeners beginning their exploration of the conflict, as well as a thrilling analysis and reimagining of its events for experienced students of the war.</p>";
