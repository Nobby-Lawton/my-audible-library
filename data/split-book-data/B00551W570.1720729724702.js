window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Academy Award nominee <b>Samuel L. Jackson</b> (<i>Pulp Fiction</i>) rocks this mock bedtime story, capturing a hilarious range of emotions as the voice of a father struggling to get his child to sleep. </p> <p><i>Go the F--k to Sleep</i> is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don’t always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland. California Book Award-winning author Adam Mansbach’s profane, affectionate, and radically honest verses perfectly capture the familiar - and unspoken - tribulations of putting your little angel down for the night. In the process, he opens up a conversation about parenting, granting us permission to admit our frustrations and laugh at their absurdity. </p> <p>Beautiful, subversive, and pants-wettingly funny, <i>Go the F**k to Sleep</i> is a book for parents new, old, and expectant. Due to its explicit language, you probably should not play it for your children. </p> <p>Feel free to share the link to this page with tired parents and other people who could use a good swear and a laugh.</p>";
