window.bookSummaryJSON = "In <i>Havana Nocturne</i>, T. J. English offers a riveting, multifaceted true tale of organized crime, political corruption, roaring nightlife, revolution, and international conflict that interweaves the dual stories of the mob in Havana and the event that would overshadow it: the Cuban Revolution. <p>Bringing together long-buried historical information and English's own research in Havana - including interviews with the era's key survivors - <i>Havana Nocturne</i> takes listeners back to Cuba in the years when it was a veritable devil's playground for mob leaders Meyer Lansky and Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. Thanks to strong ties with the island's brutal dictator, President Batista, the mob soon owned the biggest luxury hotels and casinos and launched an unprecedented tourist boom.</p> <p>But their dreams collided with those of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and others who would lead the country's disenfranchised to overthrow their corrupt government and its foreign partners - an epic cultural battle that English captures in all its sexy, decadent, ugly glory.</p>";
