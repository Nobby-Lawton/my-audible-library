window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David M. Potter's Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Impending Crisis</i> is the definitive history of antebellum America. Potter's sweeping epic masterfully charts the chaotic forces that climaxed with the outbreak of the Civil War: westward expansion, the divisive issue of slavery, the Dred Scott decision, John Brown's uprising, the ascension of Abraham Lincoln, and the drama of Southern secession. <i>The Impending Crisis</i> remains one of the most celebrated works of American historical writing. </p>";
