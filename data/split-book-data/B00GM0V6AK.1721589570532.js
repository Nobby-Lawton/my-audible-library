Using the English alphabet as a unique, offbeat way to approach the subject, Professor McWhorter has crafted a hopscotch tour of some of the field's major topics, hot-button issues, and more. </p> <p>You'll learn why it can actually be OK to use slang like \"LOL.\" Why English speakers don't use words like \"thou\" and \"thee\" anymore. What makes \"mama\" and \"papa\" a child's first words-in many languages. How popular rhymes like \"Eeny, meeny, miney, moe\") actually derive from the words for numbers in an early relative of Welsh. Why \"like\" is here to stay in common American speech. And much more. </p> <p>These and other fascinating topics are all delivered in Professor McWhorter's light-hearted yet informative teaching style, which makes this series essential for anyone looking for a welcoming window into the quirks, curiosities, and intricacies of how language works.
