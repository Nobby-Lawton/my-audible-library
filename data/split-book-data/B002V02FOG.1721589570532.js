window.bookSummaryJSON = "From the beloved <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, a quintessential Nick Hornby tale of music, superfandom, and the truths and lies we tell ourselves about life and love. <p>Annie loves Duncan - or thinks she does. Duncan loves Annie, but then, all of a sudden, he doesn't. Duncan really loves Tucker Crowe, a reclusive Dylanish singer-songwriter who stopped making music 10 years ago. Annie stops loving Duncan, and starts getting her own life. In doing so, she initiates an e-mail correspondence with Tucker, and a connection is forged between two lonely people who are looking for more out of what they've got.</p> <p>Tucker's been languishing (and he's unnervingly aware of it), living in rural Pennsylvania with what he sees as his one hope for redemption amid a life of emotional and artistic ruin - his young son, Jackson. But then there's also the new material he's about to release to the world: an acoustic, stripped-down version of his greatest album, <i>Juliet</i> - entitled, <i>Juliet, Naked</i>.</p> <p>What happens when a washed-up musician looks for another chance? And miles away, a restless, childless woman looks for a change? <i>Juliet, Naked</i> is a powerfully engrossing, humblingly humorous novel about music, love, loneliness, and the struggle to live up to one's promise.</p>";
