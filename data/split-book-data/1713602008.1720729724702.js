I loved it.”—Mark Sullivan, bestselling author of </b><b><i>Beneath a Scarlet Sky</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Last Green Valley</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p><b>Bestselling author Robert Dugoni returns with an emotionally arresting follow-up to </b><b><i>The Extraordinary Life of Sam Hell</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>In 1979, Vincent Bianco has just graduated high school. His only desire: collect a little beer money and enjoy his final summer before college. So he lands a job as a laborer on a construction crew. Working alongside two Vietnam vets, one suffering from PTSD, Vincent gets the education of a lifetime. Now forty years later, with his own son leaving for college, the lessons of that summer—Vincent’s last taste of innocence and first taste of real life—dramatically unfold in a novel about breaking away, shaping a life, and seeking one’s own destiny.</p>";
