window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this “compelling, bighearted, emotionally precise page-turner” (<i>Sunday Times</i>), the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling writer and acclaimed television host explores the aftermath of a tragedy on a small town to illuminate the shame and longing that can flow through generations - and how the secrets of the heart cannot stay be buried forever.</p> <p>It is 1987, and a small Irish community is preparing for a wedding. The day before the ceremony, a group of young friends, including the bride and groom, are involved in an accident. Three survive. Three are killed.</p> <p>The lives of the families are shattered and the rifts between them ripple throughout the small town. Connor survived, but living among the angry and the mourning is almost as hard as carrying the shame of having been the driver. He leaves the only place he knows for another life, taking his secrets with him. Travelling first to Liverpool, then London, he eventually makes a home - of sorts - for himself in New York, where he finds shelter and the possibility of forging a new life.</p> <p>But the secrets - the unspoken longings and regrets that have come to haunt those left behind - will not be silenced. Before long, Connor will have to confront his past.</p> <p>A powerful and timely novel of emigration and return, <i>Home Stretch</i> demonstrates Norton’s keen understanding of the power of stigma and secrecy - and their devastating effect on ordinary lives. </p>";
