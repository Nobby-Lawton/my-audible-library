window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Life We Bury</i></b><b> comes a </b><b><i>\"</i></b><b>riveting, hold-your-breath\" new mystery in which a woman finds herself in a race not only for justice - but for her life (Karin Slaughter, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Silent Wife</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p>Lila Nash is on the verge of landing her dream job - working as a prosecutor under the Hennepin County Attorney - and has settled into a happy life with her boyfriend, Joe Talbert. But when a woman is pulled from the Mississippi River, barely alive, things in the office take a personal turn.</p> <p>The police believe the woman’s assailant is local photographer Gavin Spenser, but the case quickly flounders as the evidence wears thin. It seems Gavin saw this investigation coming - and no one can imagine how carefully he has prepared.</p> <p>The more determined Lila is to put Gavin behind bars, the more elusive justice becomes. Battling a vindictive new boss and haunted by the ghosts of her own unspeakable attack, which she’s kept a dark secret for eight long years, Lila knows the clock is ticking down. In a race against an evil mastermind, it will take everything Lila’s got to outsmart a killer - and to escape the dark hold of her own past.</p> <p><b>“In </b><b><i>The Stolen Hours</i></b><b>, there’s not a moment misplaced or a second lost. With the precision of a watchmaker, Eskens assembles the fine parts of a mystery and sets them to the tempo of a thriller, leaving the reader breathless.” (Craig Johnson, author of the Walt Longmire Mysteries)</b></p>";
