window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Read by Juliet Stevenson and Simon Callow, <i>A Literary Christmas</i> is a seasonal anthology that collects together poems, short stories, and prose extracts by some of the greatest poets and writers in the English language. </p> <p>Like Charles Dickens’ ghosts of Christmas Past and Present, they are representative of times old and new - from John Donne’s Elizabethan hymn over the baby Jesus to Rudyard Kipling’s \"Christmas in India\", from Thomas Tusser counting the cost of a Tudor feast to Laurie Lee’s \"Cider with Rosie\". </p> <p>Enjoy a convivial Christmas Day as described by Samuel Pepys, Anthony Trollope, George Eliot, or Nancy Mitford. Venture out into the snow in the company of Jane Austen, Henry James, and Dickens’ ever-popular Mr Pickwick. Entertain the children with the seasonal tales of Dylan Thomas, Kenneth Grahame, Louisa May Alcott, and George Mackay Brown.</p> <p><b>Please note: This is a vintage recording, and the audio quality reflects the technology of the time.</b></p>";
