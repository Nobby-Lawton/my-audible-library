window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Australian General Sir John Monash changed the way wars were fought and won. When the British and German High Commands of the First World War failed to gain ascendancy after four years of unprecedented human slaughter, Monash used innovative techniques and modern technology to plan and win a succession of major battles that led to the end of the Great War. </p> <p>But Australia's greatest military commander fought as many battles with those on his side as he did with his enemies. Monash was the classic outsider who rose to greatness despite the mighty odd of his 'handicaps of birth' – having a German-Jewish background at a time when racism and prejudice were rife: and being a part-time colonial soldier in an Imperial British army. </p> <p>Roland Perry brings to life the fascinating story of the man whom many have judged as the greatest ever Australian. <i>Monash</i> draws on the subject's comprehensive letter and diary archive – one of the largest in Australia's history. The result is a riveting portrait that weaves together the many strands of his life as a family man, student, engineer, businessman, lawyer, teacher, soldier, leader, romantic and lover of the arts; and reveals why, in addition to his amazing military successes, Monash is remembered and respected even more for his humanity.</p>";
