window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A girl comes of age with a vengeance - and help from a friend - in a tale of unnerving suspense from National Book Award winner and literary master Joyce Carol Oates.</p> <p>Bad things have been happening since Mia began to mature. Her dad left. Boys at school can’t keep their hands to themselves. A lecherous stepfather has moved in. Her only refuge is an abandoned lot on her suburban cul-de-sac, crawling with feral felines - one of which follows Mia home. Ghostly white and affectionate, she is Mia’s new companion and - as Mia’s tormenters will soon discover - her fierce protector.</p> <p><i>Joyce Carol Oates’s </i>Miao Dao<i> is part of </i>Dark Corners<i>, a collection of seven heart-stopping short stories by bestselling authors who give you so many new reasons to be afraid. Each story can be read in a single sitting. Or, if you have the nerve, you can listen all by yourself in the dark.</i></p>";
