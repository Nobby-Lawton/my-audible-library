window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Simon Winchester, the acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>The Professor and the Madman,</i> delivers his first book about America: a fascinating popular history that illuminates the men who toiled fearlessly to discover, connect, and bond the citizenry and geography of the U.S.A. from its beginnings. </p> <p>How did America become “one nation, indivisible”? What unified a growing number of disparate states into the modern country we recognize today? To answer these questions, Winchester follows in the footsteps of America’s most essential explorers, thinkers, and innovators, such as Lewis and Clark and the leaders of the Great Surveys; the builders of the first transcontinental telegraph and the powerful civil engineer behind the Interstate Highway System. He treks vast swaths of territory, from Pittsburgh to Portland, Rochester to San Francisco, Seattle to Anchorage, introducing the fascinating people who played a pivotal role in creating today’s United States. </p> <p>Throughout, he ponders whether the historic work of uniting the States has succeeded, and to what degree. <i>The Men Who United the States</i> is a fresh look at the way in which the most powerful nation on Earth came together.</p>";
