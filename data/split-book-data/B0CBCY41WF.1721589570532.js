Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond.</p> <p>While many narrative set pieces of <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river’s banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin…), Jim’s agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.</p> <p>Brimming with the electrifying humor and lacerating observations that have made Everett a “literary icon” (<i>Oprah Daily</i>), and one of the most decorated writers of our lifetime, <i>James </i>is destined to be a major publishing event and a cornerstone of twenty-first century American literature.</p>";
