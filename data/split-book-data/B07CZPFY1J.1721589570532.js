Obsessed with the idea of breaking the law, Raskolnikov resolves to kill an old pawnbroker for her cash.</p> <p>Although the murder and robbery are bungled, Raskolnikov manages to escape without being seen. And with nothing to prove his guilt and a mendacious confessor in police custody, Raskolnikov seems to have committed the perfect crime. But in Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s world of moral transgressions, with its reason and its consequences, Raskolnikov’s plan has a devastating hitch: the feverish delirium of his own conscience.</p> <p>AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling.
