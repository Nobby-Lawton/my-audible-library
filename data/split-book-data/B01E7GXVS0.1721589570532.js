window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Built in 1927, the German ocean liner <i>Cap Arcona</i> was the greatest ship since the <i>Titanic</i>. When the Nazis seized control, she was stripped down for use as a floating barracks and troop transport. Hitler's minister, Joseph Goebbels, later cast her as a \"star\" in the epic propaganda film about the sinking of the legendary <i>Titanic</i>. </p> <p>In the Third Reich's final desperate days, when SS <i>Cap Arcona</i> was mistakenly bombed by the British Air Force, concentration camp prisoners packed the ship. Although the British government sealed many documents pertaining to the ship's sinking, Robert P. Watson has unearthed forgotten records and conducted many interviews. <i>The Nazi Titanic</i> is a riveting and astonishing story about an enigmatic ship that played a devastating role in World War II. </p>";
