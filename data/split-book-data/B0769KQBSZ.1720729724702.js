What were your feelings as you looked down on Earth for the first time? Were you ever scared? Where to next - the moon, Mars, or beyond? </p> <p>Based on his historic mission to the International Space Station, <i>Ask an Astronaut</i> is Tim Peake's guide to life in space and his answers to the thousands of questions he has been asked since his return to Earth. With explanations ranging from the mundane (how do you wash your clothes or go to the bathroom while in orbit?) to the profound (do humans have a duty to explore the unknown?), all written in Tim's characteristically warm style, Tim shares his thoughts on every aspect of space exploration. </p> <p>From training for the mission to launch to his historic spacewalk to reentry, he reveals for listeners of all ages the cutting-edge science behind his groundbreaking experiments and the wonders of daily life onboard the International Space Station. </p>";
