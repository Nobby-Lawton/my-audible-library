And even more disturbing, when she goes to report the incident, she can’t recall her own name. All she has on her is a train ticket home. </p> <p>Suffering from stress-induced amnesia, the woman without a name is a source of mystery when she appears at the sleepy Wiltshire village where she thought she lived.
