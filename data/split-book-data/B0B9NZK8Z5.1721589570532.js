window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>**A Goodreads Choice Awards Nomination for Best History &amp; Biography**</b></p> <p><b>**An NPR Book We Love*</b></p> <p><b>A race-against-the-clock narrative that finally illuminates a history-changing event: the IRA’s attempt to assassinate Margaret Thatcher and the epic manhunt that followed.</b></p> <p>A bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army exploded at 2:54 a.m. on October 12, 1984. It was the last day of the Conservative Party Conference at the Grand Hotel in the coastal town of Brighton, England. Rooms were obliterated, dozens of people wounded, five killed. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was in her suite when the explosion occurred; had she been just a few feet in another direction, flying tiles and masonry would have sliced her to ribbons. As it was, she survived—and history changed.</p> <p><i>There Will Be Fire</i> is the gripping story of how the IRA came astonishingly close to killing Thatcher, in the most spectacular attack ever linked to the Northern Ireland Troubles. Journalist Rory Carroll reveals the long road to Brighton, the hide-and-seek between the IRA and British security services, the planting of the bomb itself, and the painstaking search for clues and suspects afterward.</p> <p>In <i>There Will Be Fire</i>, Carroll draws on his own interviews and original reporting, reveals new information, and weaves together previously unconnected threads. <i>There Will Be Fire</i> is journalistic nonfiction that comes across like a thriller, propelled by a countdown to detonation.</p>";
