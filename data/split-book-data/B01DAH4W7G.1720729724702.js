window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Three friends, one dog, one boat, one river. What could go wrong? Plenty. </p> <p>Even when the sailing is smooth, the stories never stop in Jerome K. Jerome's comic novel. Plaster fishes, dead water rats, near-death escapes, and many, many jocose anecdotes create a colorful narrative of holiday life on the river. For once three hypochondriacs self-diagnose themselves as \"clearly overworked\", the rest practically writes itself! </p>";
