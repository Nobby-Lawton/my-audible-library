window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Already optioned for film, <i>The Girl with a Clock for a Heart</i> is Peter Swanson's electrifying tale of romantic noir, with shades of Hitchcock and reminiscent of the classic movie <i>Body Heat</i>. It is the story of a man swept into a vortex of irresistible passion and murder when an old love mysteriously reappears. </p> <p>On an ordinary Friday evening at his favorite Boston tavern, George Foss's comfortable, predictable life is shattered when a beautiful woman sits down at the bar, a woman who vanished without a trace twenty years ago. </p> <p>Liana Dector isn't just an ex-girlfriend, the first love George couldn't quite forget. She's also a dangerous enigma and quite possibly a cold-blooded killer wanted by the police. Suddenly, she's back - and she needs George's help. Ruthless men believe she stole some moneyâ€¦and they will do whatever it takes to get it back. </p> <p>George knows Liana is trouble. But he can't say no - he never could - so he makes a choice that will plunge him into a terrifying whirlpool of lies, secrets, betrayal, and murder from which there is no sure escape. </p> <p>Bold and masterful, full of malicious foreboding and subtle surprises, <i>The Girl with a Clock for a Heart</i> is an addictive, nonstop thriller - an ever-tightening coil of suspense that grips you right up to its electrifying end. </p>";
