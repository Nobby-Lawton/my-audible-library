window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana, <i>Nostromo</i> explores the volatile politics and crippling greed surrounding the San Tomé silver mine. The story of power, love, revolutions, loyalty, and reward is told with richly evocative description and brilliantly realised characters. But <i>Nostromo</i> is more than an adventure story; it is also a profoundly dark moral fable. Its language is as compellingly resonant as the sea itself; the characters absorbing and complex. It was Conrad’s masterwork, a forerunner of Modernism, and one of the greatest novels of the 20th century.</p>";
