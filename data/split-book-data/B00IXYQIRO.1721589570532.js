window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One Viking woman. One God. One legendary journey to North America. </p> <p>In the 10th century, when pagan holy women rule the Viking lands, Gudrid turns her back on her training as a seeress to embrace Christianity. Clinging to her faith, she joins her husband, Finn, on a journey to North America. </p> <p>But even as Gudrid faces down murderous crewmen, raging sickness, and hostile natives, she realizes her greatest enemy is herself - and the secrets she hides might just tear her marriage apart. </p> <p>Almost five centuries before Columbus, Viking women sailed to North America with their husbands. <i>God's Daughter, Book 1</i> in the Vikings of the New World Saga, offers an expansive yet intimate look into the world of Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir - daughter-in-law of Eirik the Red, and the first documented European woman to have a child in North America. </p>";
