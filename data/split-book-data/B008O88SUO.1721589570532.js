window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ford Madox Ford’s tetralogy, set in England during World War I, is widely considered one of the best novels of the 20th century. </p> <p>First published as four separate novels (<i>Some Do Not…, No More Parades, A Man Could Stand Up,</i> and <i>The Last Post</i>) between 1924 and 1928, <i>Parade’s End</i> explores the world of the English ruling class as it descends into the chaos of war. </p> <p>Christopher Tietjens is an officer from a wealthy family who finds himself torn between his unfaithful socialite wife, Sylvia, and his suffragette mistress, Valentine. A profound portrait of one man’s internal struggles during a time of brutal world conflict, <i>Parade’s End</i> bears out Graham Greene’s prediction that \"there is no novelist of this century more likely to live than Ford Madox Ford.\"</p>";
