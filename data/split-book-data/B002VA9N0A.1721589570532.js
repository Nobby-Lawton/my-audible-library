window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"After the first forty days we were alone,\" writes Churchill. This edition is part two of Churchill's own abridgement of his original six-volume history of the Second World War. </p> <p>Please note: This book was originally published in six volumes: </p> <p>1. The Gathering Storm <br>2. Their Finest Hour <br>3. The Grand Alliance <br> 4. The Hinge of Fate <br> 5. Closing the Ring <br> 6. Triumph and Tragedy </p> <p>Churchill then condensed these into four volumes, which have since been released as one, rather hefty, publication. This is an unabridged recording of Churchill's condensed volume, broken up into four parts, as follows: </p> <p>1. Milestone to Disaster <br> 2. Alone <br> 3. The Grand Alliance <br> 4. Triumph and Tragedy</p>";
