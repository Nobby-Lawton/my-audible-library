window.bookSummaryJSON = "Richard Henry Dana referred to this book as \"a voice from the sea\". It influenced Conrad and Melville, and has become a maritime classic that has inspired legions of men with a passion for the sea. <p>Dana, a law student turned sailor for health reasons, sailed in 1834 aboard the brig <i>Pilgrim</i> on a voyage from Boston around Cape Horn to California. (Hence the city name Dana Point.) Drawing from his journals, <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i> gives a vivid and detailed account, shrewdly observed and beautifully described, of a common sailor's wretched treatment at sea, and of a way of life virtually unknown at that time.</p>";
