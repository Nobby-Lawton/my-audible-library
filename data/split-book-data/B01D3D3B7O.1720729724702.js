window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Now a television mini-series airing on National Geographic May 2020! </b></p> <p>A <i>Washington Post</i> Best Book of the Year and a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book from the Pulitzer Prize-­­winning author of <i>The Shipping News</i> and <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> comes the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling epic about the demise of the world’s forests.</p> <p>“<i>Barkskins</i> is grand entertainment in the tradition of Dickens and Tolstoy…the crowning achievement of Annie Proulx’s distinguished career, but also perhaps the greatest environmental novel ever written.” (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).</p> <p>In the late 17th century, two young Frenchmen, René Sel and Charles Duquet, arrive in New France. Bound to a feudal lord for three years in exchange for land, they become wood-cutters — barkskins. René suffers extraordinary hardship, oppressed by the forest he is charged with clearing. He is forced to marry a native woman and their descendants live trapped between two cultures. But Duquet runs away, becomes a fur trader, then sets up a timber business. Annie Proulx tells the stories of the descendants of Sel and Duquet over 300 years — their travels across North America, to Europe, China, and New Zealand — the revenge of rivals, accidents, pestilence, Indian attacks, and cultural annihilation. Over and over, they seize what they can of a presumed infinite resource, leaving the modern-day characters face to face with possible ecological collapse. </p> <p>“A stunning, bracing, full-tilt ride through three hundred years of US and Canadian history…with the type of full-immersion plot that keeps you curled in your chair, reluctant to stop reading” (<i>Elle</i>), <i>Barkskins</i> showcases Proulx’s inimitable genius of creating characters who are so vivid that we follow them with fierce attention. </p> <p>“This is Proulx at the height of her powers as an irreplaceable American voice” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, Grade A), and <i>Barkskins</i> “is an awesome monument of a book” (<i>The Washington Post</i>) — “the masterpiece she was meant to write” (<i>The Boston Globe</i>). </p> <p>As Anthony Doerr says, “This magnificent novel possesses the dark humor of<i> The Shipping News</i> and the social awareness of <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>.\" </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
