window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Falklands War was one of the strangest in British history - 28,000 men sent to fight for a tiny relic of empire 8,000 miles from home. </p> <p>At the time, many Britons saw it as a tragic absurdity, but the British victory confirmed the quality of British arms and boosted the political fortunes of the Conservative government. But it left a chequered aftermath; it was of no wider significance for British interests and taught no lessons. It has since been overshadowed by the two Gulf Wars, however, its political ramifications cannot be overestimated. Max Hastings’ and Simon Jenkins’ account of the conflict is a modern classic of war reportage and the definitive book on the war. Republished as part of the Pan Military Classics series, <i>The Battle for the Falklands</i> is a vivid chronicle of a call to arms and a thoughtful and informed analysis of an astonishing chapter in the history of our times. Max Hastings, author of over 20 books, has been editor of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Evening Standard</i>. He has won many awards for his journalism, particularly his work in the south Atlantic in 1982.</p>";
