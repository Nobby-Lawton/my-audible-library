window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Leon Uris retums to the land of his acclaimed best-seller <i>Exodus</i> for an epic story of hate and love, vengeance and forgiveness. The Middle East is the powerful setting for this sweeping tale of a land where revenge is sacred and hatred noble. Where an Arab ruler tries to save his people from destruction but cannot save them from themselves. When violence spreads like a plague across the lands of Palestine - this is the time of <i>The Haj.</i></p>";
