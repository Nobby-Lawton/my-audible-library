window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The acclaimed BBC Radio 4 dramatisation of Anthony Trollope's gently satirical tales of provincial life</b><br> <br> One of the most respected, successful chroniclers of nineteenth-century life, Anthony Trollope is still widely read and much-loved today. <i>The Barchester Chronicles</i> - witty moral comedies with a wonderful range of characters - are among his most popular tales.<br> <br> The first in the series, <i>The Warden</i>, finds Rev. Harding forced to question the moral basis of the life he is leading; and in the sequel, <i>Barchester Towers</i>, the Reverend is now plain Mr Harding, bound up in a tale of intrigue, hypocrisy and ambition that will delight the listener.<br> <br> <i>Dr Thorne</i> is a gripping drama of wealth and wedlock; while <i>Framley Parsonage</i> tells the story of a naive, ambitious young clergyman whose unwise associations bring him to the brink of ruin. <i>The Small House at Allington</i> explores the power of devotion, in the form of Lily Dale’s love for self-seeking Adolphus Crosbie.<br> <br> Finally, <i>The Last Chronicle of Barset</i> sees the most popular characters from Trollope’s earlier novels, including the Proudies, Lily, Mr Harding and Archdeacon Grantly, reunited in a moving tale of honesty triumphing over hypocrisy.<br> <br> Nearly twenty hours of ironic, witty and wonderfully written drama is contained in this collection. With a star cast including <b>Brenda Blethyn</b>, <b>Eleanor Bron</b>, <b>Kenneth Cranham</b>, <b>Anna Massey</b>, <b>Leo McKern</b>, <b>Simon Russell Beale</b>, <b>Amanda Root, Alex Jennings, David Haig, Rosemary Leach </b>and <b>Emma Fielding</b>, it is guaranteed to appeal to all fans of Trollope’s comic masterpieces.<br> <br> </p>";
