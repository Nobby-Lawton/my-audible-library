window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Black Dahlia</i>, <i>The Big Nowhere</i>, <i>L.A. Confidential</i>, <i>White Jazz</i>, <i>American Tabloid</i>.... </p> <p>James Ellroy's high-velocity, best-selling novels have redefined noir for our age, propelling us within inches of the dark realities of America's recent history. In <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i>, his most ambitious and explosive novel yet, he puts the whole of the 1960s under his blistering lens. The result is a work of fierce, epic fiction, a speedball through our most tumultuous time. </p> <p>It begins in Dallas. November 22, 1963. The heart of the American Dream detonated. </p> <p>Wayne Tedrow Jr., a young Vegas cop, arrives with a loathsome job to do. He's got $6,000 in cash and no idea that he is about to plunge into the cover-up conspiracy already brewing around Kennedy's assassination, no idea that this will mark the beginning of a hellish five-year ride through the private underbelly of public policy. </p> <p>Ellroy's furiously paced narrative tracks Tedrow's ride: Dallas back to Vegas, with the Mob and Howard Hughes, south with the Klan and J. Edgar Hoover, shipping out to Vietnam and returning home, the bearer of white powder, plotting new deaths as 1968 approaches....</p> <p>Tedrow stands witness, as the icons of an iconic era mingle with cops, killers, hoods, and provocateurs. His story is ground zero in Ellroy's stunning vision: historical confluence as American nightmare.</p> <p><i>The Cold Six Thousand</i> is a masterpiece. </p> <p><b><i>Please note:</i></b><i> This 2001 recording represents the technology of the time when it was produced. This is currently the best available source audio from the publisher.</i></p>";
