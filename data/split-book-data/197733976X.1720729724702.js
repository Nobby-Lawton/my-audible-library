window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An epic novel by an award-winning author chronicles the settling of the Ohio River Valley, home to the defiant Shawnee Indians, who vow to defend their land against the seemingly unstoppable.</b></p> <p>They came on foot and by horseback, in wagons and on rafts, singly and by the score, restless, adventurous, enterprising, relentless, seeking a foothold on the future. European immigrants and American colonists, settlers and speculators, soldiers and missionaries, fugitives from justice and from despair-pioneers all, in the great and inexorable westward expansion defined at its heart by the majestic flow of the Ohio River. This is their story, a chronicle of monumental dimension, of resounding drama and impact set during a pivotal era in our history: the birth and growth of a nation.</p> <p>Drawing on a wealth of research, both scholarly and anecdotal-including letters, diaries, and journals of the era-Allan W. Eckert has delivered a landmark of historical authenticity, unprecedented in scope and detail.</p>";
