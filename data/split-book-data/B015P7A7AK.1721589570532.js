window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the author of <i>The Days of Abandonment</i> comes <i>The Lost Daughter</i>, Elena Ferrante's most compelling and perceptive meditation on womanhood and motherhood yet. </p> <p>Leda, a middle-aged divorcee, is alone for the first time in years when her daughters leave home to live with their father. Her initial, unexpected sense of liberty turns to ferocious introspection following a seemingly trivial occurrence. Throughout the novel, Ferrante's language is as finely tuned and intense as ever, and she treats her theme with a fierce, candid tenacity. </p>";
