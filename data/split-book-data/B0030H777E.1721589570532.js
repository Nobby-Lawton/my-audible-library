window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A wonderful, splendid book - a book that should be ready by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future.\" (Howard Fast)</b></p> <p>For much of his life, historian Howard Zinn chronicled American history from the bottom up, throwing out the official version taught in schools - with its emphasis on great men in high places - to focus on the street, the home, and the workplace.</p> <p>Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, <i>A People's History of the United States</i> is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of - and in the words of - America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles - the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality - were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance.</p> <p>Covering Christopher Columbus' arrival through President Clinton's first term, <i>A People's History of the United States</i> features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history.</p>";
