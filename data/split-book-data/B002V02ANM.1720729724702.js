window.bookSummaryJSON = "In the summer of 2004, the National Endowment for the Arts organized a series of writing workshops, led by prominent authors, to encourage U.S. troops and their families to record their experiences and reflections on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The result is this extraordinary volume of first-hand letters, poems, journals, memoirs, and e-mails from the men and women directly involved in battle and their families back home. <p>This uniquely personal addition to the long tradition of war literature covers the entire arc of a soldier's journey, from those first experiences of combat, encounters with Iraqis and Afghans, and the humor and boredom of the daily grind, to the physical and emotional toll of battle, the struggle of loved ones back home to carry on, and finally the return and integration back into American life.</p> <p>Featured on the cover of the <i>New Yorker</i> and in various print and TV news programs, this rich historical document will preserve the stories of American troops at a crucial moment in American history.</p> <p>Edited by Andrew Carroll. Read by Sandi Austin, Joe Barrett, David Birney, Stephen Bonnell, Richard Brewer, Scott Brick, Emily Janice Card, Orson Scott Card, Andrew Carroll, Ross Cohen, Gabrielle De Cuir, Harlan Ellison, Robert Forster, Kirby Heyborne, Stephen Hoye, Arte Johnson, Stephen Lang, Rex Linn, Kathe Mazur, John Rubinstein, Stefan Rudnicki, Judith Smiley, Mirron E.
