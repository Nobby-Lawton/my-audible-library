window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Groundbreaking in its inclusiveness, enthralling in its narrative of a movement whose purpose, in the words of Leon Trotsky, was \"to overthrow the world\", <i>The Russian Revolution</i> draws conclusions that aroused great controversy in this country. Richard Pipes argues convincingly that the Russian Revolution was an intellectual, rather than a class, uprising; that it was steeped in terror from its very outset; and that it was not a revolution at all but a coup d'etat - \"the capture of governmental power by a small minority.\"</p>";
