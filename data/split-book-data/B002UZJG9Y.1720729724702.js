window.bookSummaryJSON = "Winner of the 1982 National Book Award for Biography, <i>Mornings on Horseback</i> is the brilliant biography of the young Theodore Roosevelt. Hailed as a masterpiece by <i>Newsday</i>, it is the story of a remarkable little boy, seriously handicapped by recurrent and nearly fatal attacks of asthma, and his struggle to manhood. <p> His father, the first Theodore Roosevelt, \"Greatheart\", is a figure of unbounded energy, enormously attractive and selfless, a god in the eyes of his small, frail namesake. His mother, Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt, is a Southerner and celebrated beauty.</p> <p> <i>Mornings on Horseback</i> spans 17 years, from 1869 when little \"Teedie\" is 10, to 1886 when he returns from the West a \"real life cowboy\" to pick up the pieces of a shattered life and begin anew, a grown man, whole in body and spirit.</p> <p> This is a tale about family love and family loyalty; about courtship, childbirth and death, fathers and sons; about gutter politics and the tumultuous Republican Convention of 1884; about grizzly bears, grief and courage, and \"blessed\" mornings on horseback at Oyster Bay or beneath the limitless skies of the Badlands. </p>";
