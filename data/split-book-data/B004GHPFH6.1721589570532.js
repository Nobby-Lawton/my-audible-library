window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first book to appear in the illustrious Oxford History of the United States, this critically-acclaimed volume - a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize - offers an unsurpassed history of the Revolutionary War and the birth of the American republic. </p> <p>This panoramic view of the conflict between England and America combines the political and the personal, giving the listener a vivid sense of how the colonists perceived the events of their struggle for independence, from the French and Indian War to “the shot heard round the world”, and the importance the colonists assigned to them.</p> <p>Praised as “state of the art” and “the most distinguished series in American historical scholarship”, the four new volumes of the Oxford History of the United States – including <i>The Glorious Cause</i> – are narrated with engagingly casual warmth by Robert Fass, who previously read an earlier volume in the series, <i>Empire of Liberty</i>, by Gordon S. Wood. </p> <p><b>Please note:</b> The individual volumes of the series have not been published in historical order. <i>The Glorious Cause </i> is number III in The Oxford History of the United States.</p>";
