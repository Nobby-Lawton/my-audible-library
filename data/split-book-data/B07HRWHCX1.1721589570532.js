window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The gripping sequel to Pulitzer Prize-winner Herman Wouk’s stunning historical novel <i>The Hope</i>...</p> <p><i>The Glory</i> plunges immediately into the violence and upheaval of the Six-Day War of 1967 - and continues the dramatic story of Israel’s struggle for survival. A sprawling, action-packed novel, Wouk takes listeners through the terrors of the Yom Kippur War, the famous Entebbe rescue, and the airstrikes on Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor - ending with the final hope for peace. Illuminating the inner lives of real Israeli leaders - including David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, and Ariel Sharon - with both insight and compassion, Wouk tells the story of Israel’s struggle to exist with an authoritative, gripping style that demonstrates not only the broad significance of this time in history, but also its personal impact on those who lived through it. </p> <p>About the author: Herman Wouk is one of the most widely-read American authors in the world. His books have been translated into 27 languages, and many of his works have become best sellers. He is perhaps best known for <i>The Winds of War</i> and <i>War and Remembrance</i>, an exhaustively-researched two-part historical series telling the story of World War II from the perspective of two fictional families whose lives were irrevocably changed by the war and the Holocaust. Sixteen years in the making, the epic involved extensive archival research including travel for research to England, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Israel. <i>The Winds of War</i> and <i>War and Remembrance</i> were adapted for television in a 30-hour series that won the 1989 Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries and was, according to ABC, “the most watched television show in history.” </p> <p>Born in New York City to Russian-Jewish parents, Wouk graduated from Columbia University and started out working as a comedy writer for Fred Allen’s radio show. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he joined the Navy, serving in eight Pacific invasions and earning several battle stars. During his service in the Pacific he had turned to writing, like Lieutenant Keefer in <i>The Caine Mutiny</i>, for an hour or two before dawn. After his discharge in 1946, Wouk finished his first novel, which became a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and he soon followed up with the international best sellers <i>The Caine Mutiny</i> and <i>Marjorie Morningstar</i>. </p> <p>Wouk won the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for fiction for <i>The Caine Mutiny</i>. He has also been awarded numerous academic honors, including a degree from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In January 2001, UC San Diego established the Herman Wouk Chair of Modern Jewish Studies, and in 2008 he was given the first Library of Congress Lifetime Achievement Award for the Writing of Fiction.</p>";
