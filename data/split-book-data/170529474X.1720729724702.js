But as he sees more and more planes shot down in flames, he begins to question the war, and what, or who, he is fighting for. </p> <p>There is no bitter snarl nor self-pity in this classic novel about the air war of 1914-1918, based very largely on the author's experiences. </p> <p>Combat, loneliness, fatigue, fear, comradeship, women, excitement - they all are part of a brilliantly told story of war and courage by one of the most valiant pilots of the then-Royal Flying Corps.</p>";
