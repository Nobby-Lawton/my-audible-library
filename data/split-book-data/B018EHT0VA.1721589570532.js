window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Britain's empire has gone. Our manufacturing base is a shadow of its former self; the Royal Navy has been reduced to a skeleton. In military, diplomatic and economic terms, we no longer matter as we once did. And yet there is still one area in which we can legitimately claim superpower status: our popular culture. </p> <p>It is extraordinary to think that one British writer, J. K. Rowling, has sold more than 400 million books; that <i>Doctor Who</i> is watched in almost every developed country in the world; that James Bond has been the central character in the longest-running film series in history; that <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is the second best-selling novel ever written (behind only <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>); that the Beatles are still the best-selling musical group of all time; and that only Shakespeare and the Bible have sold more books than Agatha Christie. </p> <p>To put it simply, no country on Earth, relative to its size, has contributed more to the modern imagination. This is a book about the success and the meaning of Britain's modern popular culture, from Bond and the Beatles to heavy metal and <i>Coronation Street</i>, from the Angry Young Men to Harry Potter, from Damien Hirst to <i>The X Factor</i>.</p>";
