window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Internationally best-selling author Lyndsay Faye became enamored with tales of Sherlock Holmes and his esteemed biographer, Dr. John Watson, as a child and later began spinning these quintessential characters into her own works of fiction - from her acclaimed debut novel, <i>Dust and Shadow</i>, which pitted the famous detective against Jack the Ripper, to a series of short stories for the <i>Strand Magazine</i>, whose predecessor published the very first Sherlock Holmes short story in 1891. </p> <p>In \"The Lowther Park Mystery\", the unsociable Holmes is forced to attend a garden party at the request of his politician brother and improvises a bit of theater to foil a conspiracy against the government. \"The Adventure of the Thames Tunnel\" brings to Holmes' attention the baffling murder of a jewel thief in the middle of an underground railway passage. With Holmes and Watson encountering all manner of ungrateful relatives, phony psychologists, wronged wives, plaid-garbed villains, and even a peculiar species of deadly red leech, <i>The Whole Art of Detection</i> is a must-listen for Sherlockians and any fan of historical crime fiction with a modern sensibility. </p>";
