A terrifying cautionary essay, <i>Panic</i> explores the combustible mix of unfounded fears, moral crusades, and the dangers of collective thinking.</p> <p>Panic <i>is part of</i> Bloodlands<i>, a chilling collection of short addictive historical narratives from bestselling true-crime master Harold Schechter. Spanning a century in our nation’s murderous past, Schechter resurrects nearly forgotten tales of madmen and thrill-killers that dominated the most sensational headlines of their day.</i></p>";
