window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Independent, stunning, and smart, Kell Jameson has the life she's always dreamed about. A partner at a tiny Atlanta law firm that represents famous - if guilty - clients, she's far from her days as a lonely orphan in rural Georgia. But one frantic phone call will bring her back to the place she's spent years trying to escape. The head of her childhood orphanage has been accused of murder, and Kell is her only hope for freedom. </p> <p>From the first moment Kell meets Sheriff Luke Calder, tempers and attraction flare. Ruggedly handsome and a stickler for law and order, Luke finds Kell compelling. Unfortunately, she represents his prime suspect. Forced to work together, they dig deep into the town's scandals... but Kell has a secret of her own. She trusts Luke enough to fall in love - but does she trust him enough to reveal the reckless past she's worked so hard to keep hidden?</p>";
