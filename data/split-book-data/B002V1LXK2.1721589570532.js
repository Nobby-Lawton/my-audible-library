window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Agincourt</i></b><b> is classic Cornwell...[with] attention to historical detail, well-paced action, and descriptive writing that is a pleasure to read.\" (</b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Bernard Cornwell, the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling \"reigning king of historical fiction\" (<i>USA Today</i>), tackles his most thrilling, rich, and enthralling subject yet - the heroic tale of <i>Agincourt</i>. The epic battle immortalized by William Shakespeare in his classic Henry V is the background for this breathtaking tale of heroism, love, devotion, and duty from the legendary author of the Richard Sharpe novels and the Saxon Tales. This extraordinary adventure will captivate from minute one, proving once again and most powerfully, as author Lee Child attests, that \"nobody in the world does this stuff better than Cornwell.\"</p>";
