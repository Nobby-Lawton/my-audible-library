window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A series of brutal home invasions terrified Los Angeles in 1937. They ended in Chicago a year later with the arrest of African American teenager Robert Nixon, igniting racial tensions in an already appallingly divided city.</p> <p>Tortured in custody and portrayed by the press in the most lurid and flagrantly racist terms, Nixon faced an all-white jury. It would be the fastest conviction in the history of Cook County. Used as inspiration for Richard Wright’s classic social protest novel, <i>Native Son</i>, the case against Nixon is a still-relevant examination of bigotry, suppressed rage, and the making of a murderer.</p> <p>The Brick Slayer <i>is part of</i> Bloodlands<i>, a chilling collection of short addictive historical narratives from bestselling true-crime master Harold Schechter. Spanning a century in our nation’s murderous past, Schechter resurrects nearly forgotten tales of madmen and thrill-killers that dominated the most sensational headlines of their day.</i></p>";
