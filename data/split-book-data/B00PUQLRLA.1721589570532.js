window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Sleepwalkers</i> is historian Christopher Clark's riveting account of the explosive beginnings of World War I. Drawing on new scholarship, Clark offers a fresh look at World War I, focusing not on the battles and atrocities of the war itself but on the complex events and relationships that led a group of well-meaning leaders into brutal conflict. Clark traces the paths to war in a minute-by-minute, action-packed narrative that cuts between the key decision centers in Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Paris, London, and Belgrade, and he examines the decades of history that informed the events of 1914 and details the mutual misunderstandings and unintended signals that drove the crisis forward in a few short weeks. </p> <p>Meticulously researched and masterfully written, <i>The Sleepwalkers</i> is a dramatic and authoritative chronicle of Europe's descent into a war that tore the world apart.</p>";
