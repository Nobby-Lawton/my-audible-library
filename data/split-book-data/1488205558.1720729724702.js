window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Featured on Oprah's Summer Reading List </b></p> <p>For readers and listeners of Delia Owens' <i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i> and Sue Monk Kidd's <i>The Secret Life of Bees</i>, this extraordinary historical debut novel follows three fierce Southern women in an unforgettable story of motherhood and womanhood. </p> <p>It's 1924 in Branchville, South Carolina, and three women have come to a crossroads. Gertrude, a mother of four, must make an unconscionable decision to save her daughters. Retta, a first-generation freed slave, comes to Gertrude's aid by watching her children, despite the gossip it causes in her community. Annie, the matriarch of the influential Coles family, offers Gertrude employment at her sewing circle, while facing problems of her own at home. These three women seemingly have nothing in common, yet as they unite to stand up to injustices that have long plagued the small town, they find strength in the bond that ties women together. Told in the pitch-perfect voices of Gertrude, Retta, and Annie, <i>Call Your Daughter Home</i> is an emotional, timeless story about the power of family, community, and ferocity of motherhood. </p> <p><b>\"Like Jill McCorkle and Sue Monk Kidd, Spera probes the comfort and strength women find in their own company.\" (</b><b><i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>\"A mesmerizing Southern tale.... Authentic, gripping, a page-turner, yet also a novel filled with language that begs to be savored.\" (Lisa Wingate, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Before We Were Yours</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
