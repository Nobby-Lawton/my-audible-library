window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After years of bullying and cajoling others as a high-flying public relations boss, Agatha Raisin’s early retirement to the picture-postcard village of Carsley in the Cotswolds is a dream come true. And how better to begin making herself a local leading light than by entering the village quiche-making competition? Unburdened by old-fashioned ideas of fair play, the ruthless Agatha decides to ensure she wins by buying her entry from a London delicatessen. Alas, Agatha’s perfect product is soon exposed - as not only store-bought but poisoned. The contest judge succumbs after eating it, and with him go Agatha’s reputation and her chances of rural bliss - unless she can expose the poisoner....</p>";
