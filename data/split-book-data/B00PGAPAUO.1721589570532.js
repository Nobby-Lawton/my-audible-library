window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Growing up Jewish in London with a difficult home life, Jonathan Wilson had plenty of reasons to feel he didn't belong, and one reason to feel certain he did: football. Wilson discovered his love for the game as a young boy; through his adolescence and adulthood and well into his later years it remained an important part of his life. Football became Wilson's international passport, helping him find friends and community and solace all over the globe, from England to Israel to the US. Whether working on a kibbutz or teaching literature to young Americans, traveling through Russia or raising children, the sport remained a constant in his life. <i>Kick and Run</i> is a gripping, funny, sometimes heartbreaking account of a life well-lived and a game played, if not always masterfully, then certainly with the utmost passion.</p>";
