window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set on the crazier fringes of 1950s literary London, <i>A Far Cry from Kensington</i> is a delight, hilariously portraying love, fraud, death, evil, and transformation. </p> <p>Mrs. Hawkins, the majestic narrator of <i>A Far Cry from Kensington</i>, takes us well in hand and leads us back to her threadbare years in postwar London. There, as a fat and much admired young war widow, she spent her days working for a mad, near-bankrupt publisher (“of very good books”) and her nights dispensing advice at her small South Kensington rooming house. </p> <p>At work and at home, Mrs. Hawkins soon uncovered evil: shady literary doings and a deadly enemy; anonymous letters, blackmail, and suicide. With aplomb, however, Mrs. Hawkins confidently set about putting things to order, little imagining the mayhem that would ensue. </p> <p>Now decades older, thin, successful, and delighted with life in Italy—quite a far cry from Kensington—Mrs. Hawkins looks back to all those dark doings and recounts how her own life changed forever. She still, however, loves to give advice: “It’s easy to get thin. You eat and drink the same as always, only half…. I offer this advice without fee; it is included in the price of this book.” </p> <p><i>A Far Cry from Kensington</i> has been hailed as “outstanding” (<i>Observer</i>), “wickedly and adroitly executed” (<i>New York Times</i>), and “a comedy that holds a tragedy as an eggcup holds an egg.” (<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>).</p>";
