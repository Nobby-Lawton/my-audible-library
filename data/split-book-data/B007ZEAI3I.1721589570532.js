window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earphones Award Winner (</b><b><i>AudioFile Magazine</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>Audie Award Winner, Audiobook of the Year, 2013</b> </p> <p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Best Solo Narration, 2013</b> </p> <p>Academy Award-winning actor Colin Firth (<i>The King’s Speech</i>) won the Audie for Audiobook of the Year in 2013—for his first audio performance, <i>The End of the Affair</i>. The love affair at the center of this 1951 classic novel takes place in the bomb-strewn last days of World War II, and just after. Bendrix, a writer in war-torn London, has fallen in love with Sarah, the wife of an acquaintance. Though unhappily married, Sarah won’t leave her husband; she ends their affair and abruptly vanishes, reducing Bendrix's inner life to rubble. His investigation of Sarah’s disappearance reveals the role her newly-awakened Catholic faith played in her decision to leave, and other startling truths.</p> <p><i>The End of the Affair</i> mirrors Greene’s own relationship with a married woman, and positions religion as a pivotal element in both the inner turmoil and outer destruction occurring in his life at the time. Firth brilliantly conveys Greene’s characteristically bleak emotional terrain in an intimate, nuanced, and unhurried performance.</p>";
