window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the number one best-selling author of </b><b><i>The Boys in the Boat</i></b><b> comes an unforgettable epic of family, tragedy, and survival on the American frontier.</b></p> <p><b>“An ideal pairing of talent and material.... Engrossing.... A deft and ambitious storyteller.” (Mary Roach, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>In April of 1846, 21-year-old Sarah Graves, intent on a better future, set out west from Illinois with her new husband, her parents, and eight siblings. Seven months later, after joining a party of pioneers led by George Donner, they reached the Sierra Nevada Mountains as the first heavy snows of the season closed the pass ahead of them. In early December, starving and desperate, Sarah and 14 others set out for California on snowshoes and over the next 32 days endured almost unfathomable hardships and horrors.</p> <p>In this gripping narrative, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Daniel James Brown sheds new light on one of the most legendary events in American history. Following every painful footstep of Sarah’s journey with the Donner Party, Brown produces a tale both spellbinding and richly informative.</p>";
