window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Kif Kehlmann, a young, penniless writer, thinks he’s finally caught a break when he’s offered $10,000 to ghostwrite the memoir of Siegfried “Ziggy” Heidl, the notorious con man and corporate criminal. Ziggy is about to go to trial for defrauding banks for $700 million; they have six weeks to write the book. </p> <p>But Ziggy swiftly proves almost impossible to work with: evasive, contradictory, and easily distracted by his still-running “business concerns” - which Kif worries may involve hiring hit men from their shared office. Worse, Kif finds himself being pulled into an odd, hypnotic, and ever-closer orbit of all things Ziggy. </p> <p>As the deadline draws near, Kif becomes increasingly unsure if he is ghostwriting a memoir or if Ziggy is rewriting him - his life, his future, and the very nature of the truth. </p> <p>By turns comic, compelling, and finally chilling, <i>First Person</i> is a haunting look at an age where fact is indistinguishable from fiction and freedom is traded for a false idea of progress. </p>";
