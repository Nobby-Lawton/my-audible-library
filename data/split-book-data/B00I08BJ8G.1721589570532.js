window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>To listen to this audiobook is to enter the perilous, thrilling world of Billy Bathgate, the brazen boy who is accepted into the inner circle of the notorious Dutch Schultz gang. Like an urban Tom Sawyer, Billy takes us along on his fateful adventures as he becomes good-luck charm, apprentice, and finally protégé to one of the great murdering gangsters of the Depression-era underworld in New York City. The luminous transformation of fact into fiction that is E. L. Doctorow's trademark comes to triumphant fruition in <i>Billy Bathgate</i>, a peerless coming-of-age tale and one of Doctorow's boldest and most beloved best sellers. </p> <p>Grateful acknowledgment is made to the following for permission to reprint previously published material: Fred Ahlert Music Corporation and Henderson Music Company: Excerpts from the lyrics to \"Bye Bye Blackbird\", lyrics by Mort Dixon, music by Ray Henderson.
