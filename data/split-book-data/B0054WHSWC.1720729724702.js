Settling herself in the shadow of Slains Castle, she creates a heroine named for one of her own ancestors and starts to write. </p> <p>But when she discovers her novel is more fact than fiction, Carrie wonders if she might be dealing with ancestral memory, making her the only living person who knows the truth-the ultimate betrayal-that happened all those years ago, and that knowledge comes very close to destroying her... </p> <p><b>Please note: This novel has also been published under a different title: <i>Sophia's Secret</i>.</b></p> <p><b>Please note, this title is the original recording, which is now known as Sophia's Secret</b></p>";
