window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Pulitzer Prize Finalist: This collection of moving short stories is “a treasure trove of lush scene setting in faraway times and places” (Alexis Burling, </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p>On a fateful flight, a balloonist makes a discovery that changes her life forever. A telegraph operator finds an unexpected companion in the middle of the Amazon. A doctor is beset by seizures, in which he is possessed by a second, perhaps better, version of himself. And in Regency London, a bare-knuckle fighter prepares to face his most fearsome opponent, while a young mother seeks a miraculous cure for her ailing son.</p> <p>At times funny and irreverent, always moving and deeply urgent, these stories—among them a National Magazine Award and a Pushcart Prize winner—cap a fifteen-year project. From the Nile's depths to the highest reaches of the atmosphere, from volcano-racked islands to an asylum on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, these are tales of ecstasy, epiphany, and what the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> called the \"struggle for survival . . . hand to hand, word to word,\" by \"one of the finest prose stylists in American fiction.\"</p> <p>A Library Journal Best Book of 2020</p>";
