Now, as they find themselves tipping into their 30-something lives of work, relationships and responsibilities, they meet up for a big reunion night out, ready to recapture their shared past. Because whilst things may not have worked out exactly to plan for any of them...at least they will always have the comfort of old friends whose lives are even more weird, skewed and off-centre than their own. </p><p>A razor sharp, witty character comedy with a warm heart which will appeal to anyone (female or male) who has ever had an awkward evening catching up after an age with old friends. </p><p><b>Please note: This audiobook contains explicit language.</b></p>";
