window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling prequel to the Pulitzer Prize-winning classic <i>The Killer Angels</i>. </p> <p>In this brilliantly written epic novel, Jeff Shaara traces the lives, passions, and careers of the great military leaders from the first gathering clouds of the Civil War. Here is Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, a hopelessly by-the-book military instructor and devout Christian who becomes the greatest commander of the Civil War; Winfield Scott Hancock, a captain of quartermasters who quickly establishes himself as one of the finest leaders of the Union army; Joshua Chamberlain, who gives up his promising academic career and goes on to become one of the most heroic soldiers in American history; and Robert E. Lee, never believing until too late that a civil war would ever truly come to pass. Profound in its insights into the minds and hearts of those who fought in the war, <i>Gods and Generals</i> creates a vivid portrait of the soldiers, the battlefields, and the tumultuous times that forever shaped the nation. </p>";
