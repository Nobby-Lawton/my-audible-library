One of the best books I’ve ever read.” —Lisa Jewell, #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author</b></p> <p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Gillian McAllister has created a thriller unlike any other in this endlessly clever, twisty story of a mother who must move backward through time to prevent tragedy from striking at the heart of her family.</b></p> <p><i>Can you stop a murder after it’s already happened?</i></p> <p>It is midnight on the morning of Halloween, and Jen anxiously waits up for her 18-year-old son, Todd, to return home. But worries about his broken curfew transform into something much more dangerous when Todd finally emerges from the darkness. As Jen watches through the window, she sees her funny, seemingly happy teenage son stab a total stranger.</p> <p>She doesn’t know who the victim is, or why Todd has committed such a devastating act of violence. All she knows is that her life, and Todd’s, have been shattered.</p> <p>After her son is taken into custody, Jen falls asleep in despair. But when she wakes up…it is yesterday. The murder has not happened yet—and there may be a chance to stop it. Each morning, when Jen wakes, she is further back in the past, first weeks, then years, before the murder. And Jen realizes that somewhere in the past lies the trigger for Todd’s terrible crime…and it is her mission to find it, and prevent it from taking place.</p> <p>Both the story of a mother’s love and the sacrifices she will make for her child, and a thriller with a brilliant twist, <i>Wrong Place Wrong Time</i> is a one-of-a-kind novel that begs to be listened to in one sitting.</p>";
