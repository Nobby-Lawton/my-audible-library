window.bookSummaryJSON = "It was a moment unique in human history: the face-to-face meeting between two men from civilizations a world apart. <p>In 1519 Hernán Cortés arrived on the shores of Mexico, determined not only to expand the Spanish empire but to convert the natives to Catholicism and carry off a fortune in gold. That he saw nothing paradoxical in his intentions is one of the most remarkable and tragic aspects of this unforgettable story.</p> <p>In Tenochtitlán, Cortés met his Aztec counterpart, Montezuma: king, divinity, and commander of the most powerful military in the Americas. Yet in less than two years, Cortés defeated the entire Aztec nation in one of the most astounding battles ever waged.</p> <p>The story of a lost kingdom, a relentless conqueror, and a doomed warrior, <i>Conquistador</i> is history at its most riveting.</p>";
