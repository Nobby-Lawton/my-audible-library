window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Based on the author's own vivid experiences, <i>The Cruel Sea</i> is the nail-biting story of the crew of HMS <i>Compass Rose</i>, a corvette assigned to protect convoys during World War II. </p> <p>Darting back and forth across the icy North Atlantic, <i>Compass Rose</i> played a deadly cat-and-mouse game with packs of German U-boats lying in wait beneath the ocean waves. Packed with tension and vivid descriptions of agonizing U-boat hunts, this tale of the most bitter and chilling campaign of the war tells of ordinary men who had to master their own fears before they could face a brutal menace - one that would strike without warning from the deep. </p>";
