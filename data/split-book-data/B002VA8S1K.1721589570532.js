window.bookSummaryJSON = "Disillusioned journalist Tom Langdon must get from Washington to L.A. in time for Christmas. Forced to take the train across the country because of a slight \"misunderstanding\" at airport security, he begins a journey of self-discovery and rude awakenings, mysterious goings-on and thrilling adventures, screwball escapades and holiday magic. He has no idea that the locomotives pulling him across America will actually take him into the rugged terrain of his own heart, as he rediscovers people's essential goodness and someone very special he believed he had lost. <p>Equal parts hilarious, poignant, suspenseful, and thrilling, David Baldacci's <i>The Christmas Train</i> is a delightful journey filled with memorable characters who have packed their bags with as much wisdom as mischief...and a story that shows how we <i>do</i> get second chances to fulfill our deepest hopes and dreams, especially during this season of miracles.</p>";
