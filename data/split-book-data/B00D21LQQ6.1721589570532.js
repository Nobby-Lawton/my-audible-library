window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Marley was dead to begin with....\" </p> <p>These chillingly familiar words begin the classic Christmas tale of remorse and redemption in <i>A Christmas Carol</i> by Charles Dickens. Now R. William Bennett rewinds the story and focuses the spotlight on Scrooge’s miserly business partner, Jacob T. Marley, who was allowed to return as a ghost to warn Scrooge away from his ill-fated path. Why was Marley allowed to return? And why hadn't he been given the same chance as Ebenezer Scrooge? </p> <p>Or had he? </p> <p>Written with a voice reminiscent of Dickens, <i>Jacob T. Marley</i> is a masterfully crafted story of remorse and redemption, sure to become a Christmas favorite.</p>";
