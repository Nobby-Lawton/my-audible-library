Learn about the people, places, and events that have influenced her work—and why Nicks’ music is as powerfully alluring today as it was when you first heard it decades ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing from <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine’s extensive archives, and his long time appreciation of Nicks, Sheffield shares the stories behind the best-selling records and the spitfire 1997 Fleetwood Mac reunion show that put the band back on top of the charts—and why Stevie Nicks still speaks to us today.
