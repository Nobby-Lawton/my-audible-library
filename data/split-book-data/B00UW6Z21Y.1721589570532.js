window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The pulse-pounding sequel to the best-selling, Edgar Award-winning <i>Red Sparrow</i> that <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> called \"terrifically good\": Star-crossed spies Dominika Egorova and CIA agent Nate Nash return in a cat-and-mouse race to the finish. </p> <p>Captain Dominika Egorova of the Russian Intelligence Service (SVR) has returned from the West to Moscow and the Center, the headquarters of her service. She finds things worse than when she left. She despises the men she must serve, the oligarchs and crooks and thugs of Putin's Russia. What no one knows is that Dominika is working for the CIA as Washington's most sensitive penetration of SVR and the Kremlin. </p> <p>As she expertly dodges exposure, Dominika deals with a murderously psychotic boss; survives an Iranian assassination attempt; escapes a counterintelligence ambush; rescues an arrested agent and exfiltrates him out of Russia; and has a chilling midnight conversation in her nightgown with President Putin in one of the tsar's palaces. Complicating the risks is the fact that Dominika is in love with her CIA handler, Nate Nash, and their lust is as dangerous to both of them as committing espionage in Moscow. And when a mole in the SVR finds Dominika's name on a restricted list of sources, it is a virtual death sentence. She must face off alone against her psycho boss, who's got an eight-inch knife up his sleeve. </p> <p>Just as fast paced, heart pounding, and action packed as <i>Red Sparrow</i>, Jason Matthews' second novel proves he is \"an insider's insider and a masterful storyteller\" (Vince Flynn, number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author). </p>";
