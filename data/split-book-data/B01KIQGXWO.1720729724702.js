window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earphones Award Winner (<i>AudioFile Magazine</i>) </b></p> <p><b>Winner, 2017 APA Audie Awards - History/Biography</b> </p> <p>A harrowing, adrenaline-charged account of America's worst naval disaster - and of the heroism of the men who, against all odds, survived. </p> <p>On July 30, 1945, the USS <i>Indianapolis</i> was torpedoed in the South Pacific by a Japanese submarine. An estimated 300 men were killed upon impact; close to 900 sailors were cast into the Pacific Ocean, where they remained undetected by the navy for nearly four days and nights. Battered by a savage sea, they struggled to stay alive, fighting off sharks, hypothermia, and dementia. By the time rescue arrived, all but 317 men had died. </p> <p>The captain's subsequent court-martial left many questions unanswered: How did the navy fail to realize the <i>Indianapolis</i> was missing? Why was the cruiser traveling unescorted in enemy waters? And, perhaps most amazing of all, how did these 317 men manage to survive? </p> <p>Interweaving the stories of three survivors - the captain, the ship's doctor, and a young marine - journalist Doug Stanton has brought this astonishing human drama to life in a narrative that is at once immediate and timeless. The definitive account of a little-known chapter in World War II history, <i>In Harm's Way</i> is destined to become a classic tale of war, survival, and extraordinary courage. </p>";
