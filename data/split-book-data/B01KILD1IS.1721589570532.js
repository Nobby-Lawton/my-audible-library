We understand that new words must be created for new things, but the way English is spoken today rubs many of us the wrong way. Whether it's the use of <i>literally</i> to mean \"figuratively\" rather than \"by the letter\" or the way young people use <i>LOL</i> and like, or business jargon like <i>what's the ask?</i> - it often seems as if the language is deteriorating before our eyes. </p><p>But the truth is different and a lot less scary, as John McWhorter shows in this delightful and eye-opening exploration of how English has always been in motion and continues to evolve today. Drawing examples from everyday life and employing a generous helping of humor, he shows that these shifts are a natural process common to all languages and that we should embrace and appreciate these changes, not condemn them. </p><p><i>Words on the Move</i> opens our eyes to the surprising backstories to the words and expressions we use every day. Did you know that <i>silly</i> once meant \"blessed\"? Or that <i>ought</i> was the original past tense of <i>owe</i>? Or that the suffix <i>-ly</i> in adverbs is actually a remnant of the word <i>like</i>? And have you ever wondered why some people from New Orleans sound as if they come from Brooklyn? </p><p>McWhorter encourages us to marvel at the dynamism and resilience of the English language, and his book offers a lively journey through which we discover that words are ever on the move, and our lives are all the richer for it. </p>";
