window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Instant number one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller</b></p> <p><b>Now updated with a new chapter</b></p> <p>In his first and only official autobiography, music icon Elton John reveals the truth about his extraordinary life, from his roller-coaster lifestyle as shown in the film <i>Rocketman</i>, to becoming a living legend. </p> <p>Christened Reginald Dwight, he was a shy boy with Buddy Holly glasses who grew up in the London suburb of Pinner and dreamed of becoming a pop star. By the age of 23, he was performing his first gig in America, facing an astonished audience in his bright yellow dungarees, a star-spangled T-shirt, and boots with wings. Elton John had arrived and the music world would never be the same again. </p> <p>His life has been full of drama, from the early rejection of his work with song-writing partner Bernie Taupin to spinning out of control as a chart-topping superstar; from half-heartedly trying to drown himself in his LA swimming pool to disco-dancing with Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth; from friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury, and George Michael, to setting up his AIDS Foundation to conquering Broadway with <i>Aida</i>, <i>The Lion King</i>, and <i>Billy Elliot the Musical</i>. All the while, Elton was hiding a drug addiction that would grip him for more than a decade. </p> <p>In <i>Me</i>, Elton also writes powerfully about getting clean and changing his life, about finding love with David Furnish and becoming a father. In a voice that is warm, humble, and open, this is Elton on his music and his relationships, his passions and his mistakes. This is a story that will stay with you by a living legend.</p>";
