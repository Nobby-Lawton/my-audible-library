window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Nominee, Fiction, 2013 </b></p> <p>Time and again, Ivan Doig has proven himself to be a treasure of American letters. Critical darlings and <i>New York Times</i> best sellers, his novels target the heart of the human experience and never miss the mark. </p> <p><i>The Bartender' s Tale</i> stars Tom Harry and his 12-year-old son, Rusty, who live alone and run a bar in a small Montana town in the early 1960s. Their lives are upended when Proxy, a woman from Tom's past, and her beatnik daughter, Francine, breeze into town. Is Francine, as Proxy claims, the unsuspected legacy of her and Tom’s past? Without a doubt she is an unsettling gust of the future, upending every certainty in Rusty’s life and generating a mist of passion and pretense that seems to obscure everyone’s vision but his own. </p> <p>As Rusty struggles to decipher the oddities of adult behavior and the mysteries build toward a reckoning, Ivan Doig wonderfully captures how the world becomes bigger and the past becomes more complex in the last moments of childhood.</p>";
