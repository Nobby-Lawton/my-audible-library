window.bookSummaryJSON = "1972. The Munich Olympics. Palestinian members of the Black September group murder 11 Israeli athletes. Nine hundred million people watch the crisis unfold on television, witnessing a tragedy that inaugurates the modern age of terror. <p> Back in Israel, Prime Minister Golda Meir vows to track down those responsible and, in Menachem Begin's words, \"run these criminals and murderers off the face of the earth\". A secret Mossad unit is mobilized, a list of targets drawn up. Thus begins the Israeli response, a mission that unfolds not over months but over decades. The Mossad has never spoken about this operation. No one has known the real story.
