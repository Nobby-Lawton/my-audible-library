window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now a major motion picture directed by Stephen Frears (<i>The Queen, High Fidelity</i>) and starring Judi Dench (<i>Skyfall, Notes on a Scandal</i>) and Steve Coogan (<i>The Trip, Hamlet 2</i>): the heartbreaking true story of an Irishwoman and the secret she kept for 50 years. When she became pregnant as a teenager in Ireland in 1952, Philomena Lee was sent to a convent to be looked after as a \"fallen woman\". Then the nuns took her baby from her and sold him, like thousands of others, to America for adoption. Fifty years later, Philomena decided to find him. </p> <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Philomena's son was trying to find her. Renamed Michael Hess, he had become a leading lawyer in the first Bush administration, and he struggled to hide secrets that would jeopardize his career in the Republican Party and endanger his quest to find his mother. </p> <p>A gripping exposé told with novelistic intrigue, <i>Philomena</i> pulls back the curtain on the role of the Catholic Church in forced adoptions and on the love between a mother and son who endured a lifelong separation. </p>";
