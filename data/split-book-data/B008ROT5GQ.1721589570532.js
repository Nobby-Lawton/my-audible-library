window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Although T. E. Lawrence, commonly known as \"Lawrence of Arabia\", died in 1935, the story of his life has captured the imagination of succeeding generations. <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> is a monumental work in which he chronicles his role in leading the Arab Revolt against the Turks during the First World War. A reluctant leader, and wracked by guilt at the duplicity of the British, Lawrence nevertheless threw himself into his role, suffering the blistering desert conditions and masterminding military campaigns which culminated in the triumphant march of the Arabs into Damascus.</p>";
