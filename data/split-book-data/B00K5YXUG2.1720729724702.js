window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER • The epic true story of Kim Philby, the Cold War’s most infamous spy, from the “master storyteller” (</b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><b>) and author of </b><b><i>Prisoners of the Castle.</i></b><b><br> <br> Now an MGM+ series starring Damian Lewis, Guy Pearce, and Anna Maxwell Martin</b><br> <b> </b><br> <b>“[</b><b><i>A Spy Among Friends</i></b><b>] reads like a story by Graham Greene, Ian Fleming, or John le Carré, leavened with a dollop of P. G. Wodehouse.”—Walter Isaacson, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <br> <i>Who was Kim Philby?</i> Those closest to him—like his fellow MI6 officer and best friend since childhood, Nicholas Elliot, and the CIA’s head of counterintelligence, James Jesus Angleton—knew him as a loyal confidant and an unshakeable patriot. Philby was a brilliant and charming man who rose to head Britain’s counterintelligence against the Soviet Union. Together with Elliott and Angleton he stood on the front lines of the Cold War, holding Communism at bay. But he was secretly betraying them both: He was working for the Russians the entire time. <br> <br> Every word uttered in confidence to Philby made its way to Moscow, sinking almost every important Anglo-American spy operation for twenty years and costing hundreds of lives. So how was this cunning double-agent finally exposed? In <i>A Spy Among Friends</i>, Ben Macintyre expertly weaves the heart-pounding tale of how Philby almost got away with it all—and what happened when he was finally unmasked.<br> <br> Based on personal papers and never-before-seen British intelligence files and told with heart-pounding suspense and keen psychological insight, <i>A Spy Among Friends</i> is a fascinating portrait of a Cold War spy and the countrymen who remained willfully blind to his treachery.<br> <br> <b>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: </b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly, Shelf Awareness</i></b></p>";
