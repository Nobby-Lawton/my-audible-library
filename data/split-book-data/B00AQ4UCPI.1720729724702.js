window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Ho ho ho! Here's what to listen to while driving to the mall, wrapping gifts, entertaining friends, or relaxing in front of a crackling holiday fire. </b></p> <p>In Scott Simon's modern version of the Christmas story, Jesus is born in an abandoned factory near Cleveland and the Three Wise Persons bring Chipotle gift cards. Claudia Sanchez gives a Latin accent to \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\". Barbara Bradley Hagerty explores what Christmas means for the boy choristers of the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. (Hint: Handel). In a treasured 1974 recording, humorist, author, radio personality, and blacklisting victim John Henry Faulk tells of \"the wonderfulest Christmas in the United States of America\". A son believed missing in action during WWII is found in time for his family to celebrate the holiday. And a Vietnam veteran tells <i>Weekend Edition Sunday</i> about a \"Silent Night\" that brought hope to patients in a military hospital. </p> <p>And that's just the star-topped tip of the tree. Each year, listeners tune into NPR for holiday offerings of all kinds: funny, touching, insightful, and surprising. Now anyone can listen anytime to these evergreen delights.</p>";
