window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Tech City: Society is obsessed with relentless progress and the possibility of eternal life. A woman and a man meet in waiting room, anticipating a procedure that will incorporate the latest science and technology into their minds and bodies, heightening their awareness and increasing their productivity. Years pass, their relationship deepens and fades, and they grow increasingly uncertain where the AI stops and where they begin. A romantic drama exploring the potentiality of transhumanism, <i>Life Ever After</i> is a rich listening experience that is at once naturalistic and poetic.</p> <p>Playwright Carla Grauls was awarded a commission through the Audible Emerging Playwrights Fund, an initiative dedicated to developing innovative original plays driven by language and voice. As an Audible commissioned playwright, she received funding and creative support to develop <i>Life Ever After.</i></p> <p><b>Special thanks:</b> Meroe Candy, story researcher; Dr. Gill Haddow based in Science, Technology and Innovation Studies, University of Edinburgh; Tom Douglas, Senior Research Fellow in Philosophy, University of Oxford.</p> <p>Experience this title in immersive 3D audio by <a href=\"https://help.audible.com/s/article/how-can-i-change-the-download-format-settings-in-the-audible-for-android-and-audible-for-ios-apps/\">setting your download quality to High</a> within the app. Headphones recommended.
